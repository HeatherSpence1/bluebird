    <p>I'm Heather Spence. This website is slowly coming together. 
        <p>This is my HTML only website.  Ive learned HTML and now I'm learning CSS.</p>
        <p>So This Website will only grow as I learn more.</p>
        <p>I finally took some time to sit down and quit learning for a day and get this website together.</p>
        <p>This website will be the landing page for my designs, photography, and web development.</p>
        <p>Now I have learned HTML, I was studying what Git and Github are. </p>
        <p>Ive learned about git and version control.</p>
        <p>Now I can save my website and work on it wrom anywhere and upload the changes as I go.</p>
        <p>Now on Github I've made a profile now I hope to deploy my website.</p>
        <p>That's my next step.  I know this is just an information page right now but soon it will evolve.</p>
        <p> I'm learning box model right now, for those web developers.</p>
